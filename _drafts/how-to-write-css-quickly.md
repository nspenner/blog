A lot of developers don't like writing CSS. I don't blame them; CSS is not a very intuitive language. I think there are two major pain points that lead to frustration:

1. Lack of fundamental CSS knowledge
2. Difficulty modifying and debugging CSS efficiently

These points are closely related, but this article is specifically focused on the latter. To aid those who might not know what constitutes "fundamental CSS knowledge', here are some resources from MDN that I'd argue are required reading for a foundational understanding of CSS:

* [How CSS Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_works)
* [Cascade and Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance)
* [The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) (a lot of developers don't understand the box model, but they should)
* [Sizing Items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Sizing_items_in_CSS)
* [Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)
  * [Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
  * [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)
  * [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids)

Now, if you have a good understanding of those topics and _still_ find yourself frustrated enough when styling your webpages and apps, then you might benefit from some additional tools and methods to help you write, modify and debug your CSS.

# Using the Inspector

Most web developers have used the browser inspector at some point, but a review of its functionality never hurts. I typically use Firefox or Chrome in my daily development, so that's what I'll be focusing on here.

## Modify Elements and Classes

Right-clicking somewhere on a webpage and clicking the "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" will automatically open up the browser inspector and select the element that was originally clicked.

From there, we can view and edit all styles that have been applied to that element.

# Edit Stylesheets in the Browser

The browser is one of the best CSS editors at your disposal.
