A lot of developers don't like writing CSS. I don't blame them; CSS is not a very intuitive language, at least not at first glance. I think there are two major pain points that lead to this frustration:

1. Lack of fundamental knowledge when writing CSS
2. Difficulty modifying and debugging CSS efficiently (AKA "why doesn't it look right?")

These points are closely related, but this article is specifically focused on the second. If you don't understand the fundamentals of CSS, no amount of tools or tips are going to help you. To that end, here are some essential resources on MDN that I'd argue are required reading for a foundational understanding of CSS:

* [How CSS Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_works)
* [Cascade and Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance)
* [The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) (a lot of developers don't understand the box model, but they should)
* [Sizing Items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Sizing_items_in_CSS)
* [Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)
  * [Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
  * [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)
  * [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids)

With knowledge of those topics, writing CSS should be much easier.
