I recently created my [first portfolio site](https://nminchow.com). As I was creating it, I thought to myself *"Boy, I sure have a lot of ideas I'd like to express that went into making this. And I've encountered so many problems along the way!"*. It made me realize that writing these thoughts down might be useful, for either myself in the future or for the random soul who happens to find this blog.

So, any projects I complete in the future will be accompanied by some sort of blog post. I'm not sure how the posts will be formatted or how in-depth the write-ups will be.

Guess I'll figure it out!
