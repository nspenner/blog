Hi. I'm Nathan. I'm a software developer, musician, occasional actor, maybe game developer, and X-Files binger.

I primarily focus in front-end web development, and I've been fortunate enough to intern at some pretty awesome companies including Garmin, PaymentSpring, and First Data.

For more of my work, please see my [website](https://nminchow.com).
