Hi. I'm Nathan. I'm a software developer, musician, occasional actor, maybe game developer, and X-Files binger.

I primarily focus in front-end web development. I'm still finishing my degree, but I've already interned at some pretty awesome companies, including Garmin, PaymentSpring, and First Data.

For more of my work, please see my [website](https://nminchow.com).

I don't do much social media, but you can [email](mailto:nathan.minchow@outlook.com) me! You can also find me on [Github](https://www.github.com/nspenner) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-minchow-b165baa5/).
